- [JeGeRe](JeGeRe.md) - How to setup a test environment for Jenkins, Gerrit and the Repo tool.

## Ongoing projects
### Eiffel
Setup a demo environment using Eiffel; Maybe Jenkins, Gerrit, RabbitMQ and/or something else. [Link to repo and ongoing work/investigation.](https://github.com/CDE-Malmo/eiffel-sandbox)

## Project ideas

### Jenkins multibranch pipelines for Repo and Gerrit
Take care of a multi git repository product (using the repo tool) in a good way using Jenkins.
Building each repo separately or the actual product (manifest repo) is trivial (build trigger on changes on that repo). The challenge is how to trigger the manifest repo build whenever a change in any sub-repo is made.
And, at the same time, the actual change needs to be pulled from the ready/for branches in Gerrit.

The challenges:
- Trigger product build on a change to any subrepo, and how do we know what repos?
- When building the product, pull down the change set from Gerrit for that subrepo.

### Github Actions
Create pipeline(s) using Github Actions to run tests and deployments to "production". Look into integrating with container registries.

### Terraform
Write a terraform setup that can manage a kindoff complex infrastructure towards a cloud provider.

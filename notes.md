## Stuff that we need to have done before the first session

We can do this now:
- logo (thumbnail and normal)
- a way of finding topic
  - anyone can propose topics
  - E&A sums up a list of votable topics
  - maybe slack poll (we propose and anyone +1's)

We have to wait with these:
- access to our office
- a few people wanting to come
  - and in the new slack
- a topic
  - preparations so that we can do it
  - maybe google cloud payment thing, or some other cloud provider

## Brainstorming

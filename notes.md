## Let's get started
Before we can have an actual session, let's do what we can to build this up so that we can hit the ground running. An idea is to have something weekly, where we invite one new person to an online session (an hour or something), pitch CDE-Malmö and maybe come up with some good future projects. Then we can invite another person every week or two. When we have a few persons in Slack, we can start doing "homework" exercises and show each other how it goes (like a demo).

### The plan
1. Weekly session - one by one (to pitch the idea, get feedback and build up the community).
1. Have mini-sessions online to get going until we can have a proper session in the office.

## Stuff that we need to have done before the first session

We can do this now:
- logo (thumbnail and normal)
- a way of finding topic
  - anyone can propose topics
  - E&A sums up a list of votable topics
  - maybe slack poll (we propose and anyone +1's)

We have to wait with these:
- access to our office
- a few people wanting to come
  - and in the new slack
- a topic
  - preparations so that we can do it
  - maybe google cloud payment thing, or some other cloud provider

## Brainstorming
*CDE-Malmö is going to help you spread your wings on your DevOps journey.*

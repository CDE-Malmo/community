## Repo Dockerized
We completed the project, minor things left, but we know it works.

https://github.com/CDE-Malmo/repo-dockerized

Next time:
- Publish it
- Shrink it

## Mini retro

Good:
- Live Share worked well, at least with 3 people
- This has great potential when we learn to utilize it better
- 3 sessions are good (1-2 hours each)

Could be improved:
- Take turns writing. Like mob programming.

## Thoughts on the "process" so far

After we had first mini-online session with "external" participant:

- Hassle with sharing (screen, remote session, etc.)
  - People need to have tested to share/mics/etc before the meeting starts.
- If this were "proper" session, then we needed to have more in slack (at least started the first two points in the "process" below). Also figuring out what the deliverable will be (or aimed for).
  - Everyone can pitch in in their own pace.
  - Some research can be done beforehand, which is crucial for the shorter sessions (but good for the longer ones as well).

Plan is to finalize the project next week. And then do another one with another "external".

How do we do with membership for the organisation?
- Members have only read access currently.
- We change this now so that members have write-access as default to all repos.
- If the repo becomes something more, we need to set more protection, for instance protecting the master branch from force pushes.

## Repo Dockerized
We started to work on the new project.

https://github.com/CDE-Malmo/repo-dockerized

## The "process"
1. Update on the topic
2. What do we want to accomplish?
3. Do we need a repo - create it.
4. More ideas?
5. Start working.
6. Create some kind of deliverable - docs/code/working sw

## Mini-session I
- Invite feedback: Worked for PA, but for someone that don't know some of the background, more "selling" is needed.
- Explained what CDE-Malmö
- How much time should we spend on this session?  1,5 - 2 hours / week
- Pick a topic
  - Dockerize Repo Tool - So that anyone can start using it on their machine without messing around.
- Feedback: When suggesting topics, write a story why this is a good topic or why this is needed (problems or bad experiences are always good to share).

## First mini-session
- Try out the concept with two Praqmates.
  - Invite to Slack, tell them about the webpage and that we want to do a "trial".
  - Feedback on how the invite should be done.
- Have a first meeting where we:
  - need to be prepared to explain what CDE-Malmö is.
  - choose topic. It could be anything, it's up to the four of us to decide. Backup-topic is Elastic/Logstash/Kibana/etc.
  - Feedback on the mini-session.

## Let's get started
Before we can have an actual session, let's do what we can to build this up so that we can hit the ground running. An idea is to have something weekly, where we invite one new person to an online session (an hour or something), pitch CDE-Malmö and maybe come up with some good future projects. Then we can invite another person every week or two. When we have a few persons in Slack, we can start doing "homework" exercises and show each other how it goes (like a demo).

### The plan
1. Weekly session - one by one (to pitch the idea, get feedback and build up the community).
1. Have mini-sessions online to get going until we can have a proper session in the office.

## Stuff that we need to have done before the first session

We can do this now:
- logo (thumbnail and normal)
- a way of finding topic
  - anyone can propose topics
  - E&A sums up a list of votable topics
  - maybe slack poll (we propose and anyone +1's)

We have to wait with these:
- access to our office
- a few people wanting to come
  - and in the new slack
- a topic
  - preparations so that we can do it
  - maybe google cloud payment thing, or some other cloud provider

## Brainstorming
*CDE-Malmö is going to help you spread your wings on your DevOps journey.*

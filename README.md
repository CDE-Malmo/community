## Our idea

> We want to create a place where we can solve problems, share ideas and try new things together with other like-minded people.

## Our values

- We love hands-on, but sometimes a good discussion can be great.
- We publish everything as open source; we hope to help everyone to improve and we'd love to get feedback from as many as possible.
- We want to improve our understanding of issues and what's out there.
- We dive into problems before figuring out the solutions.

## How we collaborate

- No selling from stage.
- Be yourself, relax, enjoy beverages and chit chat; it's not a formal meeting.
- Each session is topically driven, but the agenda is driven by the participants.
- We use [Slack](cde-malmo.slack.com) to communicate and share ideas. [Click here to join](https://join.slack.com/t/cde-malmo/shared_invite/zt-ecmtvnw4-agxlQ2InUqRTwin3FC4ehg).

## CDE-Malm√∂ projects
The projects can be different in nature; hands-on, discussions, solve a specific issue, etc. But the thing that connects them is that there is a real outcome; a script, a solution, the problem, etc.

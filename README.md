# Our idea

> We want to create a place where we can solve problems, share ideas and try new things together with other like-minded people.

# Our values

- We love hands-on, but sometimes a good discussion can be great.
- We publish everything as open source; we hope to help everyone to improve and we'd love to get feedback from as many as possible.
- We want to improve our understanding of issues and what's out there.
- We dive into problems before figuring out the solutions.


# How we collaborate

- No selling from stage.
- Be yourself, relax, enjoy beverages and chit chat; it's not a formal meeting.
- Each session is topically driven, but the agenda is driven by the participants.


# Projects

### Jenkins Gerrit Repo environment
We're setting up a test/demo/playground environment for the combination Jenkins, Gerrit and Repo. In a way so that it's easy to replace any of the tools without extensive efforts.

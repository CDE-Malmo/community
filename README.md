# Our idea

Beverages, snacks and chit chat

Each session is topically driven

Brainstorm what problem we want to solve and figure out how to solve it

Everything published is open source

# Our values

Focus on problems

Open Source

A fun and relaxed time

No selling from stage

# Our way of working

Let's figure it out together

# Projects

We're setting up a test/demo/playground environment for the combination Jenkins, Gerrit and Repo.
- [JenkinsGerritRepo](projects/JeGeRe.md)
- It should be done in such a way so that it's easy to replace any of the tools without extensive efforts.
